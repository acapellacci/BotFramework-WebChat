This is the only work that occurs in the main thread.\r\n *\r\n *  - We normalize and de-duplicate events to account for browser quirks. This\r\n *    may be done in the worker thread.\r\n *\r\n *  - Forward these native events (with the associated top-level type used to\r\n *    trap it) to `EventPluginHub`, which in turn will ask plugins if they want\r\n *    to extract any synthetic events.\r\n *\r\n *  - The `EventPluginHub` will then process each event by annotating them with\r\n *    \"dispatches\", a sequence of listeners and IDs that care about that event.\r\n *\r\n *  - The `EventPluginHub` then dispatches the events.\r\n *\r\n * Overview of React and the event system:\r\n *\r\n * +------------+    .\r\n * |    DOM     |    .\r\n * +------------+    .\r\n *       |           .\r\n *       v           .\r\n * +------------+    .\r\n * | ReactEvent |    .\r\n * |  Listener  |    .\r\n * +------------+    .                         +-----------+\r\n *       |           .               +--------+|SimpleEvent|\r\n *       |           .               |         |Plugin     |\r\n * +-----|------+    .               v         +-----------+\r\n * |     |      |    .    +--------------+                    +------------+\r\n * |     +-----------.--->|EventPluginHub|                    |    Event   |\r\n * |            |    .    |              |     +-----------+  | Propagators|\r\n * | ReactEvent |    .    |              |     |TapEvent   |  |------------|\r\n * |  Emitter   |    .    |              |<---+|Plugin     |  |other plugin|\r\n * |            |    .    |              |     +-----------+  |  utilities |\r\n * |     +-----------.--->|              |                    +------------+\r\n * |     |      |    .    +--------------+\r\n * +-----|------+    .                ^        +-----------+\r\n *       |           .                |        |Enter/Leave|\r\n *       +           .                +-------+|Plugin     |\r\n * +-------------+   .                         +-----------+\r\n * | application |   .\r\n * |-------------|   .\r\n * |             |   .\r\n * |             |   .\r\n * +-------------+   .\r\n *                   .\r\n *    React Core     .

Can be called without `new`.\r\n *\r\n * ##### presetName\r\n *\r\n * MarkdownIt provides named presets as a convenience to quickly\r\n * enable/disable active syntax rules and options for common use cases.\r\n *\r\n * - [\"commonmark\"](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it/blob/master/lib/presets/commonmark.js) -\r\n *   configures parser to strict [CommonMark](http://commonmark.org/) mode.\r\n * - [default](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it/blob/master/lib/presets/default.js) -\r\n *   similar to GFM, used when no preset name given. Enables all available rules,\r\n *   but still without html, typographer & autolinker.\r\n * - [\"zero\"](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it/blob/master/lib/presets/zero.js) -\r\n *   all rules disabled. Useful to quickly setup your config via `.enable()`.\r\n *   For example, when you need only `bold` and `italic` markup and nothing else.\r\n *\r\n * ##### options:\r\n *\r\n * - __html__ - `false`. Set `true` to enable HTML tags in source. Be careful!\r\n *   That's not safe! You may need external sanitizer to protect output from XSS.\r\n *   It's better to extend features via plugins, instead of enabling HTML.\r\n * - __xhtmlOut__ - `false`. Set `true` to add '/' when closing single tags\r\n *   (`<br />`). This is needed only for full CommonMark compatibility. In real\r\n *   world you will need HTML output.\r\n * - __breaks__ - `false`. Set `true` to convert `\\n` in paragraphs into `<br>`.\r\n * - __langPrefix__ - `language-`. CSS language class prefix for fenced blocks.\r\n *   Can be useful for external highlighters.\r\n * - __linkify__ - `false`. Set `true` to autoconvert URL-like text to links.\r\n * - __typographer__  - `false`. Set `true` to enable [some language-neutral\r\n *   replacement](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it/blob/master/lib/rules_core/replacements.js) +\r\n *   quotes beautification (smartquotes).\r\n * - __quotes__ - `“”‘’`, String or Array. Double + single quotes replacement\r\n *   pairs, when typographer enabled and smartquotes on. For example, you can\r\n *   use `'«»„“'` for Russian, `'„“‚‘'` for German, and\r\n *   `['«\\xA0', '\\xA0»', '‹\\xA0', '\\xA0›']` for French (including nbsp).\r\n * - __highlight__ - `null`. Highlighter function for fenced code blocks.\r\n *   Highlighter `function (str, lang)` should return escaped HTML. It can also\r\n *   return empty string if the source was not changed and should be escaped\r\n *   externaly. If result starts with <pre... internal wrapper is skipped.\r\n *\r\n * ##### Example\r\n *\r\n * ```javascript\r\n * // commonmark mode\r\n * var md = require('markdown-it')('commonmark');\r\n *\r\n * // default mode\r\n * var md = require('markdown-it')();\r\n *\r\n * // enable everything\r\n * var md = require('markdown-it')({\r\n *   html: true,\r\n *   linkify: true,\r\n *   typographer: true\r\n * });\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * ##### Syntax highlighting\r\n *\r\n * ```js\r\n * var hljs = require('highlight.js') // https://highlightjs.org/\r\n *\r\n * var md = require('markdown-it')({\r\n *   highlight: function (str, lang) {\r\n *     if (lang && hljs.getLanguage(lang)) {\r\n *       try {\r\n *         return hljs.highlight(lang, str, true).value;\r\n *       } catch (__) {}\r\n *     }\r\n *\r\n *     return ''; // use external default escaping\r\n *   }\r\n * });\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * Or with full wrapper override (if you need assign class to `<pre>`):\r\n *\r\n * ```javascript\r\n * var hljs = require('highlight.js') // https://highlightjs.org/\r\n *\r\n * // Actual default values\r\n * var md = require('markdown-it')({\r\n *   highlight: function (str, lang) {\r\n *     if (lang && hljs.getLanguage(lang)) {\r\n *       try {\r\n *         return '<pre class=\"hljs\"><code>' +\r\n *                hljs.highlight(lang, str, true).value +\r\n *                '</code></pre>';\r\n *       } catch (__) {}\r\n *     }\r\n *\r\n *     return '<pre class=\"hljs\"><code>' + md.utils.escapeHtml(str) + '</code></pre>';\r\n *   }\r\n * });\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n **/\r\nfunction MarkdownIt(presetName, options) {\r\n  if (!(this instanceof MarkdownIt)) {\r\n    return new MarkdownIt(presetName, options);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  if (!options) {\r\n    if (!utils.isString(presetName)) {\r\n      options = presetName || {};\r\n      presetName = 'default';\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  /**\r\n   * MarkdownIt#inline -> ParserInline\r\n   *\r\n   * Instance of [[ParserInline]].

Observable. It might be useful, if you do not have control over\r\n * internal scheduler of a given Observable, but want to control when its values are emitted nevertheless.\r\n *\r\n * Returned Observable emits the same notifications (nexted values, complete and error events) as the source Observable,\r\n * but rescheduled with provided scheduler.

Original scheduler still will be used, but when the source Observable emits\r\n * notification, it will be immediately scheduled again - this time with scheduler passed to `observeOn`.\r\n * An anti-pattern would be calling `observeOn` on Observable that emits lots of values synchronously, to split\r\n * that emissions into asynchronous chunks. For this to happen, scheduler would have to be passed into the source\r\n * Observable directly (usually into the operator that creates it). `observeOn` simply delays notifications a\r\n * little bit more, to ensure that they are emitted at expected moments.\r\n *\r\n * As a matter of fact, `observeOn` accepts second parameter, which specifies in milliseconds with what delay notifications\r\n * will be emitted. The main difference between {@link delay} operator and `observeOn` is that `observeOn`\r\n * will delay all notifications - including error notifications - while `delay` will pass through error\r\n * from source Observable immediately when it is emitted. In general it is highly recommended to use `delay` operator\r\n * for any kind of delaying of values in the stream, while using `observeOn` to specify which scheduler should be used\r\n * for notification emissions in general.\r\n *\r\n * @example <caption>Ensure values in subscribe are called just before browser repaint.</caption>\r\n * const intervals = Rx.Observable.interval(10); // Intervals are scheduled\r\n *                                               // with async scheduler by default...\r\n *\r\n * intervals\r\n * .observeOn(Rx.Scheduler.animationFrame)       // ...but we will observe on animationFrame\r\n * .subscribe(val => {                           // scheduler to ensure smooth animation.\r\n *   someDiv.style.height = val + 'px';\r\n * });\r\n *\r\n * @see {@link delay}\r\n *\r\n * @param {IScheduler} scheduler Scheduler that will be used to reschedule notifications from source Observable.\r\n * @param {number} [delay] Number of milliseconds that states with what delay every notification should be rescheduled.\r\n * @return {Observable<T>} Observable that emits the same notifications as the source Observable,\r\n * but with provided scheduler.\r\n *\r\n * @method observeOn\r\n * @owner Observable\r\n */\r\nexport function observeOn<T>(this: Observable<T>, scheduler: IScheduler, delay: number = 0): Observable<T> {\r\n  return this.lift(new ObserveOnOperator(scheduler, delay));\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport class ObserveOnOperator<T> implements Operator<T, T> {\r\n  constructor(private scheduler: IScheduler, private delay: number = 0) {\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  call(subscriber: Subscriber<T>, source: any): TeardownLogic {\r\n    return source.subscribe(new ObserveOnSubscriber(subscriber, this.scheduler, this.delay));\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n/**\r\n * We need this JSDoc comment for affecting ESDoc.\r\n * @ignore\r\n * @extends {Ignored}\r\n */\r\nexport class ObserveOnSubscriber<T> extends Subscriber<T> {\r\n  static dispatch(this: Action<ObserveOnMessage>, arg: ObserveOnMessage) {\r\n    const { notification, destination } = arg;\r\n    notification.observe(destination);\r\n    this.unsubscribe();\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  constructor(destination: Subscriber<T>,\r\n              private scheduler: IScheduler,\r\n              private delay: number = 0) {\r\n    super(destination);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  private scheduleMessage(notification: Notification<any>): void {\r\n    this.add(this.scheduler.schedule(\r\n      ObserveOnSubscriber.dispatch,\r\n      this.delay,\r\n      new ObserveOnMessage(notification, this.destination)\r\n    ));\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  protected _next(value: T): void {\r\n    this.scheduleMessage(Notification.createNext(value));\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  protected _error(err: any): void {\r\n    this.scheduleMessage(Notification.createError(err));\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  protected _complete(): void {\r\n    this.scheduleMessage(Notification.createComplete());\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport class ObserveOnMessage {\r\n  constructor(public notification: Notification<any>,\r\n              public destination: PartialObserver<any>) {\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./~/rxjs/src/operator/observeOn.ts","import { Operator } from '../Operator';\r\nimport { Subscriber } from '../Subscriber';\r\nimport { Observable } from '../Observable';\r\nimport { Subject } from '../Subject';\r\nimport { Subscription, TeardownLogic } from '../Subscription';\r\nimport { tryCatch } from '../util/tryCatch';\r\nimport { errorObject } from '../util/errorObject';\r\n\r\nimport { OuterSubscriber } from '../OuterSubscriber';\r\nimport { InnerSubscriber } from '../InnerSubscriber';\r\nimport { subscribeToResult } from '../util/subscribeToResult';\r\n\r\n/**\r\n * Returns an Observable that mirrors the source Observable with the exception of an `error`.
